### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

You'll want to [install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. Here are some tips and tricks for [using the docs codebase](#working-in-the-githubdocs-repository).
  - Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need **Node.js v16** to run the site locally. See [contributing/development.md](contributing/development.md).
  - Are you contributing to markdown? We use [GitHub Markdown](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the [pull request template](#pull-request-template) to open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/github/docs/graphs/contributors).
