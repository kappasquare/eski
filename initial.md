The core utility of Eski is to serve as an API mock server that generates random data with minimal or zero coding, in an effort to eradicate the dependencies across teams (BE developer and FE developer/BE developer and Automation Developers) atleast at the initial stages of product development.

Using Eski: 
- Developers and Testers can quickly spin up a working API server that generates random data, almost exactly replicating the real world scenario.
- Additionally, Developers, Testers and Stakeholders can use the Eski Schema as a Proof of Contract. What this means is that, the Schema definition can be included as a part of the design phase of the backend API development. Once defined, the Schema becomes the source of truth of how the API is supposed to work and any deviations from that can be immedately be identified as an anomaly.
